This directory contains HCOMPRESS, the image compression package
written by Richard L. White for use at the Space Telescope Science
Institute (rlw@stsci.edu).  Briefly, the method used is:

	(1) a wavelet transform called the H-transform (a Haar transform
		generalized to two dimensions), followed by
	(2) quantization that discards noise in the image while retaining
		the signal on all scales, followed by
	(3) quadtree coding of the quantized coefficients.

The technique gives very good compression for astronomical images and
is fast, requiring about 2 seconds for compression or decompression of
a 512x512 image on a Sun SPARCstation 1.  The calculations are carried
out using integer arithmetic and are entirely reversible.
Consequently, the program can be used for either lossy or lossless
compression, with no special approach needed for the lossless case
(e.g. there is no need for a file of residuals.) Documentation on the
use of the programs and on the compression method is included in the doc
subdirectory.

These programs can compress 2-byte integer images in a small variety of
input formats.  The resulting compressed image file is machine-independent
and may be transferred between computers with binary FTP.  The source
code is reasonably machine-independent, although it has not been tested
on a wide range of machines.  Installation instructions for Unix and
VMS (VAX) machines are given in the README files in the appropriate
subdirectories.  I would be very interested to hear of any attempts to
install this code on other kinds of machines (e.g. MS-DOS, Macs.)

INSTALLATION

This version of the program has been converted to ANSI C and uses standard
build procedures.  See the INSTALL file for detailed build instructions.
For a standard build do this:

tar xzf hcomp-1.2.tar.gz
cd hcomp-1.2
./configure
make
make install

That ought to compile hcomp and install it in the standard locations.  If you
stop after 'make', the executables are in the src directory.  The configure
script has the usual options, e.g.,

./configure --prefix=/home/rlw

to change the installation location.  The installed scripts (with the default
prefix) are:

Binary executables:
/usr/local/bin/hcomp
/usr/local/bin/hdecomp

csh wrapper scripts:
/usr/local/bin/hcompress
/usr/local/bin/hdecompress
/usr/local/bin/fcompress
/usr/local/bin/fdecompress

Man page:
/usr/local/man/man1/hcompress.1

KNOWN BUGS

I know of no bugs in this version but would welcome reports of any.
