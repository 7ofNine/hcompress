hcompress 1.1
=============

2009 May

This is the first version released using the Gnu configure build
system.  Functionally the software is almost identical to the
previous (1994!) release, but one bug that affected the decompression
of images with pixel values near the bounds of the 16-bit integer
range (-32768 or 32767) has been fixed.  Note that the compressed
images are not affected by this bug, so data compressed with the
preceding version has no problems.

Other changes of note: The software has been recoded to ANSI C standards
and the interfaces have been changed to make it easily embedded
in other applications (in which case the compressed data are written
and read from an in-memory buffer rather than a file).
